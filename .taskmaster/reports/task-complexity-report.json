			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Establish Annotation Style Guide",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the annotation style guide creation into: researching existing JSDoc standards and Chinese documentation practices, defining file header templates and conventions, creating function/class annotation standards with Chinese examples, and establishing inline comment guidelines with technical analogy frameworks.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to need to establish project-wide standards, balance Chinese language requirements with technical clarity, and create comprehensive examples. Requires research, standardization, and peer validation."
		},

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Annotation Progress Tracking",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: configuring TaskMaster tool integration with repository hooks, defining annotation status workflow states and transitions, and implementing real-time progress dashboard with file-level tracking.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving tool integration, workflow design, and automation setup. Depends on Task 1 completion and requires technical configuration knowledge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Annotate Type Definitions (src/types/)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: auditing all type definition files to catalog current state, creating file headers with purpose and dependency documentation, and adding JSDoc comments to all exported types and interfaces with Chinese descriptions and usage examples.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity as it's systematic documentation work requiring understanding of type relationships and dependencies. Foundation for other annotation tasks."

			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: documenting model switching logic and AI integration patterns, annotating data flow between model management and dependent modules, and creating comprehensive JSDoc for all functions with error handling scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to AI model integration complexity, multiple dependencies, and need to explain sophisticated data flows and module interactions."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: cataloging all prompt template files across tool directories and documenting prompt template structures and helper functions with usage examples and parameter descriptions.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity as it involves systematic documentation of prompt templates. Straightforward but requires consistency across multiple tool directories."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: documenting command execution architecture and security considerations, annotating error handling and output processing mechanisms, and creating comprehensive JSDoc for all shell interaction methods with safety examples.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving shell command execution, security implications, error handling, and need to document potentially dangerous operations clearly."
